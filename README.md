# Friendly Reminder Bot

### A friendly reminder twitter bot to keep you healthy and happy.

Original idea: https://twitter.com/ykdojo/status/1524428290290638848

### How will it work?

We're going to write a piece of code that takes a random line from reminders.txt, and this bot will tweet it at a random time interval between 1-7 hours.

So it'll tweet every 4 hours on average, which gives us 6 tweets / day.

### How to contribute?

- reminders.txt: a list of reminders. Feel free to add/edit things there.
- main.py: the main Python file. Right now, it only prints a random line. We need to send this to Twitter, instead.
